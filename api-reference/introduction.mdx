## Welcome to Router.so API

Router.so provides a powerful API for managing forms and capturing leads. This API reference will guide you through the available endpoints and how to use them effectively.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the API endpoints, it's important to understand a few key concepts:

1. **Endpoints**: In Router.so, an endpoint represents a unique submission point for your forms. Each endpoint has its own ID.

2. **Leads**: A lead is created when a form is submitted to an endpoint. It contains the information provided by the user.

3. **Schemas**: You can define custom schemas for your endpoints to validate incoming data and ensure data integrity.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. You need to include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests.

bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
https://app.router.so/api

## Available Endpoints

Currently, the main endpoint available is:

- [Create Lead](/api-reference/endpoint/create): `POST /api/endpoints/{endpointId}`

This endpoint allows you to create a new lead for a specific endpoint ID.

For detailed information on how to use each endpoint, please refer to their individual documentation pages.
