# Creating an Endpoint

To create a new endpoint for your form submissions, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Create an Endpoint" page in your dashboard.

2. Fill in the following details:

   ## Endpoint Name
   Enter a unique name for your endpoint. This helps you identify the endpoint in your dashboard.

   ## Schema
   Define the structure of your form data by adding fields. For each field, specify:
   - Field name
   - Data type (choose from):
     - String
     - Number
     - Boolean
     - Date
     - Email
     - Phone
     - URL
     - Zip Code

   Click "Add Field +" to include additional fields in your schema.

   ## Enable HTML Form Posting
   Toggle this option on if you want to allow direct form submissions via HTML. When enabled, you can use the following options:

   - **Success Redirect URL**: Enter the URL where users should be redirected after a successful form submission.
   - **Fail Redirect URL**: Enter the URL where users should be redirected if the form submission fails.

   Note: Redirect URLs are only used when posting a lead by HTML form.

   ## Include Webhook
   Toggle this option on if you want to send form data to a webhook. When enabled:

   - **Webhook URL**: Enter the URL of your webhook that will receive the form data.

3. Click "Create Endpoint" to finalize the creation of your new endpoint.

# Using Your Endpoint

After creating an endpoint, you can use it in your application:

1. Copy the endpoint URL provided after creation.
2. Use this URL as the action attribute in your HTML form or as the submission URL in your JavaScript code.
3. To view detailed instructions for your specific endpoint, visit:
   ```
   app.router.so/endpoints/{your-endpoint-id}
   ```
   Replace `{your-endpoint-id}` with the actual ID of your endpoint.
   
   This page includes examples of how to use your endpoint with a basic HTML form, a JavaScript fetch call, and a React form styled with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).
