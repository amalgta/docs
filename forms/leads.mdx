# Leads Overview

The Leads page provides a comprehensive view of all form submissions received through your endpoints. This page allows you to:

- View all leads in a tabular format
- Filter leads by ID or endpoint
- Sort leads by various criteria
- Access detailed information for each lead

# Accessing the Leads Page

1. Log into your dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Leads" section in the main menu

# Understanding the Leads Table

The leads table displays the following information:

## ID
A unique identifier for each lead. This is automatically generated when a form is submitted.

## Endpoint
The name of the endpoint through which the lead was submitted.

## Date Created
The date and time when the lead was received.

## Options
Additional actions you can perform on each lead (e.g., view details, delete).

# Filtering and Sorting Leads

To help you find specific leads:

1. Use the "Filter leads by ID..." search bar to quickly locate a lead by its ID.
2. Click the "Endpoints" button to filter leads by specific endpoints.
3. Use the column headers (ID, Endpoint, Date Created) to sort the table in ascending or descending order.

# Viewing Lead Details

To access detailed information about a specific lead:

1. Locate the lead in the table
2. Click on the options menu (three dots) in the "Options" column
3. Select "View Details" from the dropdown menu

This will open a detailed view of the lead, showing all submitted form data according to the endpoint's schema.

# Managing Leads

From the leads table, you can perform various management tasks:

- **Delete**: Remove a lead from your database
- **Export**: Download lead data in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON)
- **Bulk Actions**: Perform actions on multiple leads at once (available when selecting multiple leads)

# Customizing the View

To adjust how many leads are displayed per page:

1. Locate the "Rows per page" dropdown at the bottom of the table
2. Select your preferred number of rows (e.g., 10, 25, 50)

Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages of leads
